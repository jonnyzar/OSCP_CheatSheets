```html

```

Backend code for receiver

<?php
    $name = $_GET["name"];
    $age = $_GET["age"];
    echo "Hello, my name is " . $name . " and I am " . $age . " years old.";
?>

## $_REQUEST

`$_REQUEST` is a superglobal array in PHP that contains data from both the `$_GET` and `$_POST` arrays. The `$_REQUEST` array is used to access data from HTML forms or from the URL.

```php
<?php
    if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
        $username = $_REQUEST["username"];
        echo "Hello, " . $username;
    }
?>
```
